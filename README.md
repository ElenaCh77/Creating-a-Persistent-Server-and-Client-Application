# Creating a Persistent Server and Client Application

##  Objective
The goal of this assignment is to develop a client–server application using Python sockets.

- The **server** continuously listens for incoming client connections.
- Each time a client connects:
  - The server displays a message in the terminal.
  - The server sends a **welcome message** and a **text file**.
- The **client**:
  - Connects to the server.
  - Shows the welcome message in a **popup window**.
  - Saves the received text file locally.

> Note:  
> - `message.txt` is created automatically by the server.  
> - `received_message.txt` is created automatically by the client.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Start the Server
Open a terminal in the project folder and run:
```bash
py server.py
```
Output example:
```
Server listening on 0.0.0.0:50007 ...
New client connected: ('127.0.0.1', 54321)
Sent file message.txt (30 bytes) 

````
2. Run the Client
In another terminal (or another computer on the same network):
```
py client.py
```
A popup window will appear with:
```
“Connected to the server! Welcome.”
```
The client saves the received file as received_message.txt.

3. View the Received File
In PowerShell:

```
cat .\received_message.txt
```

In Command Prompt:
```
type received_message.txt
```
Output:
```
